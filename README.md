lvi-slide-menu-controller
=========================

Yet another slide menu for iOS. 

Some features include:

 - Allows optional left and right content. 
 - Supports custom view controllers for all views. 
 - Supports portrait and landscape orientations.
 - Supports auto-resized content views.
 - Customisable edge threshold and edge overlap.
 - Cross-disolve when programatically setting the main view when no menu is showing.
 
Please feel free to contribute:

 - Improve performance on lower-end devices by displaying a static bitmap image during sliding.
 - Parallax motion and shading when sliding.
 - Soft limit when dragging the menu (currently has a hard limit for no real reason).
